# password-generator-2.0
In this repo, we will be making an application that can generate passwords

# Description
In this application, javascript was used to make a completely random password based on criteria that we were given. The user should be given an option to choose from 8-128 characters. Not only that, the user will also be given the choice whether they want it to contain upper case, lower case, numbers, and/or special characters. They will be able to mismatch and be fre to pick and choose what they want. Once they choose the criteria for their password, then the page will generate a completely unique password that they are free to use how and wherever they want.
